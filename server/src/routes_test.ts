    // httpMocks lets us create mock Request and Response params to pass into our route functions
    const req1 = httpMocks.createRequest(
        // query: is how we add query params. body: {} can be used to test a POST request
        {method: 'GET', url: '/api/dummy', query: {name: 'Zach'}}); 
    const res1 = httpMocks.createResponse();
    // call our function to execute the request and fill in the response
    dummy(req1, res1);
    // check that the request was successful
    assert.deepStrictEqual(res1._getStatusCode(), 200);
    // and the response data is as expected
    assert.deepStrictEqual(res1._getData(), {greeting: 'Hi, Zach'});
  });


  // TODO: add tests for your routes
});
